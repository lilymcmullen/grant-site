## Overview

The second component of this program was a co-convened applied data science internship course taught at both UA and LC. Small teams of students from both institutions worked together to address a real data science problem posed by a conservation stakeholder. Each cohort worked with a single partner organization over the course of the semester, producing analyses, models, and other deliverables for direct use by the partner.

Students were required to have completed an introductory data science course, such as *Data in the Wild*, prior to enrolling. Projects involved working with messy, real-world data, communicating with stakeholders with complex needs, reasoning through data ethics, and collaborating across institutions.
