## Overview

Through a supplemental award, this program extended its reach into secondary education. In partnership with The Bio/Diversity Project, an established environmental education internship program between UA, Saguaro National Park, and Tucson-area Title I schools, undergraduate interns developed and delivered data science lessons in grades 4-12 classrooms.

The supplemental program ran during years 2 and 3 of the active award. It was designed to create an earlier on-ramp to data science education while simultaneously deepening the professional development of the undergraduate interns who delivered the lessons.

## The Bio/Diversity Project Partnership

The Bio/Diversity Project has operated for over five years, training UA undergraduates to deliver high-quality, culturally-responsive environmental science lessons in Tucson-area Title I schools. For this supplemental award, a data science track was added to the existing internship. Interns received training in data science fundamentals from grant researchers and local conservation organizations, as well as pedagogical training from Bio/Diversity Project staff.

## What We Did

Undergraduate interns worked with partner teachers at Title I middle and high schools to develop and implement data science lessons aligned with Arizona state science standards. Lessons were grounded in local ecology and environmental data and culminated in student-driven action projects in which students used real-world data to investigate their local environment.
